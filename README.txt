OOP API Nabla is an adaptation of the object-oriented programming paradigm.
It includes functionalities such as defining attributes, functions, inheritance, and polymorphism.
It is compatible with your programming style as its functionalities are executed independently

How to program object-oriented?
To learn, follow the "How to create a class.hpprgm" tutorial(it's not a program or application, so you shouldn't drag it to the Connectivity Kit. Instead, you should open these files with a notepad, where you will find the step-by-step tutorial).
This tutorial explains step by step how to create a new class.
Also, check out the examples in your respective language, you can open these examples
with a notepad and paste the code into a program or application editor in the HP Prime calculator.

Keep in mind that this is a first version, the bugs and errors will eventually be fixed.
